c.lib 1.180 (23.10.2004)

- The printf() family now produces no output at all for floating point
  numbers (%e, %f and %g) if the floating point support code is disabled.
  In previous versions of the library some output (series of 0 or blank
  space characters) could still be produced.

- The scanf() family no longer ignores a conversion request of
  type '%x' (hexadecimal) and treats the number to be processed
  as in octal notation if that number begins with the digit 0.
