c.lib 1.175 (10.9.2004)

- The timeval definition in <sys/time.h> can now be used without
  having to include <exec/types.h> and <devices/timer.h>. Just
  define the __USE_CLIB2_TIMEVAL preprocessor symbol. However,
  this is intended only for code which for certain reasons cannot
  include these header files. Don't use this approach if your
  code may include <devices/timer.h> at some point.

- The sprintf() function family did not properly terminate the
  output string if the format string itself was empty. Fixed.
