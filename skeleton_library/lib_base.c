/* This routine is called after the library has been loaded into
   memory and its base data structure has been created. Here we
   must initialize those parts of the base data structure which
   have not been set up yet. As of Kickstart 2.0 the setup code
   in ROM will have initialized the entire Library structure with
   the exception of the lib_Revision field, i.e. everything that
   could be gained from the Resident structure is now in the
   Library structure. Earlier operating system releases would leave
   the entire Library structure uninitialized. For this example
   we assume that Kickstart 2.0 is around as it must be possible
   to open dos.library V37.

   The library initialization is single threaded, i.e. the operating
   system processes library initialization in a queue. The longer it
   takes for the following routine to set up the base data structure,
   the longer will other Tasks and Processes have to wait to get their
   disk resident libraries opened. This means, the initialization code
   has to be as brief as possible. This particular example code opens
   ROM resident libraries here, which is permitted. You should not
   open disk resident libraries and devices or do anything else that
   could take a long time to complete (in this context "long" is anything
   that takes up a second or longer).
