	   stdio, buffered files and file descriptors in a very particular
	   order in order to steer clear of deadlocks. The order is as given
	   above: stdio, buffered files, file descriptor table entries. Which
	   normally means that if code has any business locking stdio or the
	   file descriptor table entries, it should lock stdio first. This
	   function, at least in the UNIX_PATH_SEMANTICS variant, does not do
	   this. Here's why: if the 'stream' variable is NULL to start with,
	   no per-stream locking is performed anyway, and the stdio lock can
	   be obtained without running the risk of having obtain semaphores
	   in the wrong order. */
